            <h2 class="content-heading">Scenario: 1</h2>
            <p class="lead">According to Hubspot, “a loyalty program is a rewards program offered by a company to customers who frequently make purchases. A loyalty program may give a customer free merchandise, rewards, coupons, or even advance released product. (Kolowich)” It means that the customers are more likely to come back because they are able to build points or rewards which will benefit them in the future. Moreover, Hubspot states that it is better to use a simple point system than something that is more difficult to understand. In addition to using a simple method, it also states that the reward program should be able to reward initial loyalty in the first place. Most importantly, it is crucial to measure the effectiveness of the loyalty program that you are using because the effectiveness is all that matters when it comes to understanding and predict customer’s purchasing behavior.<br>The article from the Marketing Science Institute (MSI), suggests that “A customer portfolio perspective can indicate the loyalty program’s opposing effects on target versus bystander customers. (Steinhoff, Palmatier)” In other words, it is important to see the customer’s purchasing behavior by creating a portfolio, or some kind a system to track the purchases made by customers. There are three studies that were related to the topic of rewards program and according to MSI, “the findings provide evidence for why and when loyalty programs fail. (Steinhoff, Palmatier)” The authors also suggest following the effectiveness of the rewards program as well.<br>The most interesting article we found was from the Webstaurant Store. It specifically suggests how to start a loyalty rewards program for the restaurants. In the article, it tells you how to earn a customer’s loyalty as well. More importantly, the article states the importance of following the customer's habits. For example, from the article, “you don’t want to make it seem like earning rewards takes too much effort. (Webstaurant)” It is because the result of making it so difficult to earn rewards will take the customers away from the restaurant. So according to the Webstaurant.com, restaurants should not make the rewards difficult to earn, but make the rewards programs simple, offer incentives, and listen to the customer’s feedback. It is because that is what the customers want, and in order to make customers to visit again, the restaurant’s owner must understand the ultimate goal of customers taking benefits of rewards program.<br>A study from Jang and Mattila An examination of restaurant loyalty programs: what kinds of rewards do customers prefer?“ found that majority of the customers of restaurants insist receiving an immediate benefits from using the rewards program in the restaurant. Since the customers want an immediate rewards from the restaurant, it becomes more difficult for the restaurants to provide rewards program. It is because the restaurants need to provide discounts on their menu in order to give immediate rewards and benefits. Therefore, as explained in the study from Jang and Mattila, “developing an effective loyalty reward program requires a thorough understanding of what kinds of rewards are perceived favorably by the firm’s customer base.” In other words, the rewards program must be effective in order to carry its purpose of providing such program.<br>As we interviewed Leah Kim and Bryan Park; we explained our solution to the scenario. Although they agreed that starting a reward program is a good idea, both Leah said that “rewards programs sometimes make customers turn away from the business, like starbucks.(Kim)” She said that because she is one of the starbucks holic and she was very frustrated when starbucks changed their program in a way that customers nowadays have to spend more time to earn a free drink. On the other hand, Bryan stated that “I really don’t care about rewards program because I’m too lazy to carry the reward card for every restaurant that I go to.(Park)” This clearly proves the negative aspects of using reward card for loyalty benefit because it simply would not benefit the restaurant if the reward program is not effective. We then later randomly interviewed 8 people asking them if rewards programs influence their choice of brand. The results are shown in the data/visualisation section.<br>In the beginning of the project, we were not so sure about the effectiveness of the rewards program because there was still an uncertainty of the solution. However, by researching the studies from google scholar and other articles, we realized an approximate range of effectiveness. We were also able to realized the importance of understanding the customers’ behavior. Moreover, we learned that rewards programs may become useless if they do not fulfil the customer’s interest. It means that in order to create positive relationship with customers through loyalty program requires a greater understanding of customers’ desire.<br>Throughout the project, we were able to find well written articles and a study that pinpoints the important factor of rewards program, and it ultimately helped us to come up with a solution. The articles and a study provided a lot of support to our solution as well. However, we believe that we could have came up with a better solution if we had more time to think deeper into the problem. It is because creating a rewards program may seem too mundane for someone. However, thinking outside of the box with longer time to think about how to approach an issue do not always guarantee a better solution. In conclusion, although we believe we could have done better if we had just little more time to; however, there is no guarantee that our solution could have been better because the study we found provides a good information of the importance of loyalty benefits on rewards program.</p>
