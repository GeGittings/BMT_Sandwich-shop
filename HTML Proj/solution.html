            <h2 class="content-heading">Introduction</h2>
            <p class="lead">Our solution to give benefits and to build a new infrastructure of keeping customer records is to create a reward card. Because it is difficult for a new restaurant to have some kind of infrastructure to keep all the records of their customers, we tried to make our solution as simple as possible. Therefore, our rewards program will simply include the purchase records and reward redemption records on the program. It is extremely easy to understand how our reward system works.</p>

            <ol>
            	<li class="lead">Each customer revives their personal reward card upon purchasing their first sandwich.</li>
            	<li class="lead">The record of customer’s purchase is kept in our server. </li>
            	<li class="lead">Once the customer has made 10 purchases, the customer is able to use the reward points (10 points = 1 free sandwich).</li>
            	<li class="lead">The customer can redeem whenever he/she wants to redeem the points. There is no limitation on how many points the customer wants to redeem.</li>
            	<li class="lead">Once the customer redeems the points, the points will be deducted from their record.</li>
           </ol>

            <h2 class="content-heading">Target Audience</h2>
            <p class="lead">Once the restaurant is able to store their customer records, the restaurant should be able to have a better idea of which sandwich is more popular and they can prepare more ingredients for popular sandwiches in order to spend more effectively. Another reason why we chose a reward card is because the restaurant must target college students since the restaurant is located near campus. In order to have effective marketing and strategy, the rewards points should be easy to receive. Therefore we have not added more than just one condition to receive the points. We believe this is going to be an effective way to bring more customers and keep the track of customer’s purchasing behavior at the same time because the points are very easy to receive and the customers also gain benefit of purchasing a sandwich from the restaurant. We thought making the most effective rewards program is very important since the article from the Webstaurant clearly stated that “effectiveness of rewards program is the most essential part of starting a rewards program.(Webstaurant.com)”</p>
